- Need to finish proposal
	- build a language that focuses on general DFA/NFA and offers the functionality to build regular expressions
	- set operations can be used on both general FSM's and regular expressions
	- sentence segmentation 

Tools for user: highest precedence decomposition, maybe D()
Ex: 
	x = a
	x2 = x* //basically a*
	D(x2) = [* , a]

Ex:
	alphabet = {a,b,c,d}
	RegX x1 = ( (a b) | c)*
	D(x1) = [*, (a b) | c]

	D((a b) | c) = [| , (a b), c]
	.
