For this deliverable, we have 8 positive tests and 3 semantically negative
integration tests.

The 8 positive tests include:
  1. test-hello.xp
    - Test for printing a string. This test prints:

    Hello World!

  2. test-for1.xp
    - Test for using a "for" loop. This test loops an integer i from 0 to 4
    and prints:

    0
    1
    2
    3
    4

  3. test-while.xp
    - Test for using a while loop. Expressio does not have the while keyword
    but still uses the "for" keyword to offer while loops. This test uses
    integers a and b, and both are set to 1 and 4, respectively. The test uses
    a while loop with the condition that a < b, and the body of the loop
    increments a by 1. This test prints:

    1
    2
    3

  4. test-continue.xp
    - Test for using "continue" during a loop. This test uses a for loop to
    print from 0 to 4, but uses an if statement to check when the loop is at 3
    in which "continue" is used to skip the printing of 3. This test prints:

    0
    1
    2
    4

  5. test-function.xp
    - Test for using an outside function being called in the main function. This
    test calls a gcd function defined outside of main and finds and prints
    the gcd of 2 and 4. This test prints:

    2

  6. test-dfa.xp
    - Test for pretty printing a "dfa" type. In this test, a DFA is defined
    and it is passed to the "printdfa" function which pretty-prints all of
    the arguments of the dfa. This test prints:


    nstates:  7
    alphabet: 0 1 2 3 4 5
    nsym:     6
    start:    4
    fin:      5 2
    nfin:     2
    delta:
            |   0 |   1 |   2 |   3 |   4 |   5
        ----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----
           0|   4    -1    -1    -1    -1    -1
           1|   3    -1    -1    -1    -1    -1
           2|  -1    -1    -1    -1    -1    -1
           3|  -1    -1    -1    -1    -1    -1
           4|  -1    -1    -1    -1    -1    -1
           5|  -1    -1    -1    -1    -1    -1
           6|  -1    -1    -1    -1    -1    -1

    7. test-printr.xp
      - Test for printing a "regexp" type. In this test, several regular
      expressions are defined and combined to form a larger regular expression,
      which is passed to the "printr" function which prints the entire
      regular expression. This test prints:

      ( a & ( c | ( c ^ a ) ) ) *

    8. test-if1.xp
      - Testing an if statement. In this test, we start with an integer a = 1,
      and testing if a is greater than or equal to 0. If the test is true,
      it prints 42. This test prints:

      42

The 3 semantically negative integration tests include:
  1. fail-break.xp
    - Semantically checking for the "break" keyword and this test fails
    because "break" is used outside of a loop.

  2. fail-continue.xp
    - Semantically checking for the "continue" keyword and this test fails
    because "continue" is used outside of a loop.

  3. fail-dfa.xp
    - Semantically checking the arguments of the "dfa" type. This test fails
    because the DFA is invalid due to the transition table of the dfa not being
    a function.
